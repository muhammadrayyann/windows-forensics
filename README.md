# Forensic Analysis of a Compromised Windows 10 System

This project documents a hands-on forensic investigation of a compromised Windows 10 machine. 
It's the second phase of my Windows red team simulation, focused on identifying attacker activity, 
collecting key artifacts, and reconstructing a timeline of the intrusion.
